Java version: 14

Notice:
In Main there is code to take linux commands to pipe the json file. If you run the command ---- and pipe a
json file it will be printed to console. However the JsonFlattener class uses objectMapper to flatten the Json file.
Unfortunately objectMapper would not work when run from console. I was not able to find a solution to this issue on time.
When run from the my intellij IDE the Json file would flatten but unfortunately as i said before would not run from the command line.

To run:
go to location of project
mvn compile
cat "Json FIle" | java -cp target/Test-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar Main
